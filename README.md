# RAG_Legal_Docs

### Problem statement & Objectives :

The main objective of this assignment is to process and analyse a collection text files containing legal agreements (e.g., NDAs) to prepare them for implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. This involves:

Understand the Cleaned Data : Gain a comprehensive understanding of the structure, content, and context of the cleaned dataset.
Perform Exploratory Analysis : Conduct bivariate and multivariate analyses to uncover relationships and trends within the cleaned data.
Create Visualisations : Develop meaningful visualisations to support the analysis and make findings interpretable.
Derive Insights and Conclusions : Extract valuable insights from the cleaned data and provide clear, actionable conclusions.
Document the Process : Provide a detailed description of the data, its attributes, and the steps taken during the analysis for reproducibility and clarity.
The ultimate goal is to transform the raw text data into a clean, structured, and analysable format that can be effectively used to build and train a RAG system for tasks like information retrieval, question-answering, and knowledge extraction related to legal agreements.

Business Value
The project aims to leverage RAG to enhance legal document processing for businesses, law firms, and regulatory bodies. The key business objectives include:

Faster Legal Research:
Reduce the time lawyers and compliance officers spend searching for relevant case laws, precedents, statutes, or contract clauses.
Improved Contract Analysis:
Automatically extract key terms, obligations, and risks from lengthy contracts.
Regulatory Compliance Monitoring:
Help businesses stay updated with legal and regulatory changes by retrieving relevant legal updates.
Enhanced Decision-Making:
Provide accurate and context-aware legal insights to assist in risk assessment and legal strategy.
